⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Use your actual/complete Resend API key (get it from Resend Dashboard → Settings → API Keys)

### 2. Verify Sender Email in Resend
**Time: 3 minutes**

Go to: https://dashboard.resend.com → Verified Domains & Senders

Check if `Michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com` is marked as **Verified**
- ✅ If verified → Continue to Step 3
- ❌ If not verified → Click "Add Email" and complete verification
