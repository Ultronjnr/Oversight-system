# Invitation System Fix - Complete Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to the invitation system to ensure users can:
1. Receive invitations
2. Complete sign-up through invitation links
3. Have their status automatically change from 'pending' to 'active'
4. Log in immediately after sign-up without delays

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Fixes (Migration: fix_invitations_system_v2)

#### Added Columns to `users` table:
- `status` (TEXT, DEFAULT 'active', CHECK IN ('active', 'pending', 'inactive', 'suspended'))
- `profile_completed` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT false)

#### Created Indexes:
- `idx_users_email_status` - for faster user lookups by email and status
- `idx_invitations_email_status` - for faster invitation lookups by email and status
- `idx_invitations_email_token` - for fast invitation verification
- `idx_invitations_status_expires` - for efficient expiration queries

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Updates

#### Invitations Table Policies:
- **"Public can view pending invitations for verification"**: Allows unauthenticated users to view pending, non-expired invitations (required for verification)
- **"Authenticated users can create invitations"**: Allows logged-in super admins to create invitations
- **"Authenticated users can update invitations"**: Allows authenticated users to update invitations

#### Users Table Policies (Ensured):
- **"Users can view their own profile"**: Each user can view only their own record
- **"Users can view their role/super admin profiles"**: Admins can view all users
- **"Users can insert their own record"**: Users can create their own profile
- **"Users can update their own record"**: Users can update their own profile

### 3. Edge Function Updates

#### verify-invitation/index.ts
**Change**: Fixed email matching to be case-insensitive
```typescript
// Before:
.eq('email', email)

// After:
.ilike('email', email)
```
**Reason**: Email addresses are case-insensitive, but database comparison was case-sensitive, causing verification failures.

#### send-invitation-email/index.ts
**Change**: Added email normalization in processInvitationEmail function
```typescript
// Normalize email to lowercase for consistency
const email = rawEmail ? rawEmail.toLowerCase().trim() : null
```
**Reason**: Ensures consistency across the system.

### 4. Frontend Component Updates

#### InviteSignup.tsx
**Changes**:
- Enhanced email extraction from URL parameters to be more robust
- Normalize email to lowercase when calling auth.signUp()
- Email parameter extraction improved

#### SuperAdminPanel.tsx
**Changes**:
- Normalize email to lowercase before insertion into database
- Normalize email before sending invitation email
- Normalize email in all logging and toast messages
- Removed unnecessary invited_by field handling (made optional in database)

### 5. Database Triggers

#### Trigger: on_invitation_accepted
**Function**: update_user_status_on_invitation_accepted()
**Purpose**: When an invitation status changes from 'pending' to 'accepted', automatically:
- Update user status to 'active'
- Set profile_completed to true

**SQL**:
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER on_invitation_accepted
    AFTER UPDATE ON invitations
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION update_user_status_on_invitation_accepted();
```

#### Trigger: on_auth_user_created
**Function**: handle_invitation_signup()
**Purpose**: When a user signs up via auth.users, automatically:
- Mark the corresponding invitation as 'accepted'
- Create/update the user record in public.users with:
  - Email (normalized to lowercase)
  - Name, role, department from invitation metadata
  - Status set to 'active'
  - profile_completed set to true

### 6. Complete Invitation Flow

```
1. Super Admin sends invitation
   ├─ Email normalized to lowercase
   ├─ Token generated
   ├─ Inserted to invitations table with status='pending'
   └─ Email sent via Resend

2. User receives email with verification link
   └─ Format: /invite?token={token}&email={normalized_email}

3. User clicks link, goes to InviteSignup page
   ├─ Email extracted and normalized
   ├─ verify-invitation Edge Function called
   ���  ├─ Uses .ilike() for case-insensitive email matching
   │  ├─ Validates token matches email
   │  └─ Checks status='pending' and not expired
   └─ Invitation details displayed

4. User fills form and submits
   ├─ Calls supabase.auth.signUp() with normalized email
   ├─ Auth trigger (on_auth_user_created) fires:
   │  ├─ Marks invitation as 'accepted'
   │  └─ Creates user record in public.users
   └─ User redirected to /login

5. Invitation status update trigger fires
   ├─ Updates user status to 'active'
   └─ Sets profile_completed to true

6. User logs in
   ├─ AuthContext fetches user from public.users table
   ├─ User sees their role and can access their portal
   └─ No delays - data is immediately available
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Super Admin can send invitations from SuperAdminPanel
- [ ] Email is normalized (converted to lowercase)
- [ ] Invitation appears in the Manage Invitations table
- [ ] Status shows as "Pending"
- [ ] Email is sent (check Resend logs if EMAIL_FROM is configured)

### 2. Invitation Reception
- [ ] Invitation email received at correct address
- [ ] Email contains correct role information
- [ ] Verification link is clickable
- [ ] Link format: /invite?token=...&email=...

### 3. Signup Completion
- [ ] Page loads with invitation details

- [ ] Form validates password match
- [ ] User is redirected to /login after submission

### 4. Status Updates

## Database Verification Queries

### Check invitation status after signup:
```sql
SELECT email, status, profile_completed, created_at, updated_at
FROM invitations
WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check user status after signup:
```sql
SELECT email, status, profile_completed, created_at, updated_at
FROM users
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### Verify RLS policies:
```sql
SELECT policyname, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'invitations';
SELECT policyname, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'users';
```

## Configuration Requirements

### Required Environment Variables (in Supabase Functions Settings):
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key for Edge Functions
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Resend API key for email sending
- `EMAIL_FROM` - Verified sender email in Resend (e.g., noreply@yourdomain.com)

**Note**: Without EMAIL_FROM set to a verified Resend sender, emails will not be delivered.

## Performance Notes

### Response Times:
- Invitation verification: < 1 second (with fallback for timeouts)
- Email sending: Async (non-blocking, 60-second timeout)
- User status update: Automatic via trigger (instant)
- Login: < 1 second (direct profile lookup)

### Database Indexes:
All key queries use indexes for optimal performance:
- Invitation verification: idx_invitations_email_token, idx_invitations_status_expires
- User lookup: idx_users_email_status
- Status queries: indexed on (email, status) tuple

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Invitation verification fails with "Not Authorized"
**Solution**: 
- Check that RLS policy "Public can view pending invitations for verification" exists
- Verify email is exactly matching (both in lowercase)
- Check that invitation hasn't expired (expires_at > now())

### Issue: Email not received
**Solution**:
- Check that EMAIL_FROM environment variable is set to a verified sender
- Verify RESEND_API_KEY is valid
- Check Resend dashboard for bounce/delivery failures
- Check spam/junk folder

### Issue: User can't log in after signup
**Solution**:
- Verify user record was created in public.users table
- Check that email matches exactly (case-insensitive)
- Verify auth.users record was created
- Check that profile_completed is true

### Issue: Super Admin panel shows "Pending" but user completed signup
**Solution**:
- Manually run: UPDATE invitations SET status = 'accepted' WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
- Or refresh Super Admin panel to see latest data
