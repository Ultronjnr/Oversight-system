# Finance Portal PR Visibility - Complete Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
Finance portal was showing 0 pending PRs despite employees submitting multiple Purchase Requisitions (PRs). Employee dashboard showed 4 submitted PRs with status "Pending", but Finance portal showed no data.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Conflicting RLS Policies**: The database had multiple sets of RLS (Row Level Security) policies that were conflicting:
   - Old policies checking `auth.jwt() ->> 'role'` (JWT claims)
   - New policies checking `public.users` table role
   - Multiple definitions of the same policy with different logic

2. **User Profile Sync Issues**: Some users were created in `auth.users` but didn't have corresponding rows in `public.users` table, preventing RLS policy checks from working

3. **Policy Logic Mismatches**: Different files had different RLS policy definitions, causing inconsistent behavior across the system

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Database Migration (20250101000099_fix_finance_portal_visibility.sql)**

Applied comprehensive migration that:

#### Step 1: Sync all auth users to public.users
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  auth_user RECORD;
BEGIN
  FOR auth_user IN 
    SELECT id, email 
    FROM auth.users 
    WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM public.users)
  LOOP
    INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, role, name, department, permissions)
    VALUES (...)
    ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
  END LOOP;
END $$;
```

#### Step 2: Drop all conflicting/old RLS policies
- `admin_all_pr`
- `finance_update_all_pr`
- `finance_view_all_pr`
- `hod_update_department_pr`
- `hod_view_department_pr`
- `users_insert_own_pr`
- `users_update_own_pr`
- `users_view_own_pr`

#### Step 3: Re-create RLS policies with consistent logic
All policies now use the same pattern:
- Check user role from `public.users` table using `(SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1)`
- Use `LIMIT 1` to prevent subquery issues
- Consistent formatting and naming

Key policies restored:
```sql
-- Finance users can view ALL PRs
CREATE POLICY "Finance can view all PRs" ON public.purchase_requisitions
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (
    (SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1) = 'Finance'
  );

-- Finance users can update ALL PRs
CREATE POLICY "Finance can update all PRs" ON public.purchase_requisitions
  FOR UPDATE 
  USING (
    (SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1) = 'Finance'
  );

-- HOD users can view department PRs
CREATE POLICY "HOD can view department PRs" ON public.purchase_requisitions
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (
    (SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1) = 'HOD' 
    AND requested_by_department = (SELECT department FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid() LIMIT 1)
  );

-- Employees can view own PRs
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own PRs" ON public.purchase_requisitions
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = requested_by);
```

### 2. **Manual Database Cleanup**

Executed SQL to drop remaining conflicting policies:
```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "admin_all_pr" ON public.purchase_requisitions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "finance_view_all_pr" ON public.purchase_requisitions;
-- ... (and others)
```

### 3. **Verified Current State**

‚úÖ **Finance Users**: 2 Finance users confirmed with correct role
- kananelo@tmmbs.co.za (Finance, IT)
- michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com "David Smith" (Finance, IT)

‚úÖ **Pending PRs**: 4 PRs waiting for Finance review
- All have `finance_status = 'Pending'`
- All have `status != 'Rejected'`
- Ready to be displayed in Finance portal

‚úÖ **RLS Policies**: 8 correct policies active
- Admin can view all PRs
- Admin can update all PRs
- Finance can view all PRs ‚úì
- Finance can update all PRs
- HOD can view department PRs
- HOD can update department PRs
- Users can view their own PRs
- Users can insert their own PRs

## How It Works Now

### Employee Submits PR:
1. Employee fills form and clicks Submit
2. PR created with `finance_status = 'Pending'`, `hod_status = 'Pending'`
3. Dashboard shows PR immediately

### HOD Reviews PR:
1. HOD logs in, sees PRs from their department
2. RLS policy: `(role = 'HOD' AND department = employee_department)`
3. HOD approves/declines, updating `hod_status`

### Finance Reviews PR:
1. Finance logs in, Finance portal loads
2. Query: `finance_status = 'Pending' AND status != 'Rejected'`
3. RLS policy allows access because: `(SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE id = auth.uid()) = 'Finance'`
4. Finance sees all PRs from all departments
5. Finance approves/declines, updating `finance_status`

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Database Level (Verified)
- [x] All users synced to public.users table
- [x] Finance users have role = 'Finance'
- [x] 4 pending PRs exist with correct status
- [x] RLS policies are clean (no duplicates/conflicts)
- [x] Finance policy correctly grants access

### ‚è≥ Frontend Level (To be verified)
- [ ] Finance portal loads PRs after page refresh
- [ ] Finance portal auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- [ ] Manual "Refresh" button works
- [ ] HOD portal shows pending PRs from employees
- [ ] Employee can submit PR and see it immediately
- [ ] Full workflow: Employee ‚Üí HOD ‚Üí Finance all see updates in real-time

## How to Test

### Option 1: Manual Browser Test
1. Refresh the Finance portal page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Should see "Finance Approval Queue" with 4 pending PRs
3. Click "Refresh" button to manually reload
4. Auto-refresh every 30 seconds should show updates

### Option 2: Use Diagnostic Function
```bash
# Call the diagnostic endpoint with Finance user token
curl -X GET https://your-app.com/api/test-finance-access \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_FINANCE_USER_JWT_TOKEN"
```

This will return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "user": {
    "role": "Finance",
    "email": "michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com"
  },
  "prAccess": {
    "canAccess": true,
    "pendingPRsCount": 4
  }
}
```

## Expected Results After Fix

- ‚úÖ "Finance Approval Queue" with 4 pending PRs
- ‚úÖ Each PR shows employee name, department, amount
- ‚úÖ Approve/Decline/Split buttons available
- ‚úÖ Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ Manual Refresh button works

### HOD Portal should show:
- ‚úÖ "Department Approval Queue" with pending PRs from their department
- ‚úÖ Same PR details visible
- ‚úÖ Approve/Decline/Split buttons available

### Employee Dashboard should show:
- ‚úÖ "My Purchase Requisitions" with submitted PRs

- ‚úÖ Can see approval progress in history

## Files Modified

1. **Database Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250101000099_fix_finance_portal_visibility.sql`
2. **Diagnostic Function**: `supabase/functions/test-finance-access/index.ts`
3. **SQL Cleanup**: Applied via `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` to drop conflicting policies

## Configuration Files (No Changes Needed)
- `src/services/purchaseRequisitionService.ts` - Already correct
- `src/pages/FinancePortal.tsx` - Already has auto-refresh
- `src/pages/HODPortal.tsx` - Already correct
- `database/rls_policies.sql` - Could be updated to match new policies

## Next Steps for User

1. **Refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Log out** and **log back in** as Finance user
3. **Navigate** to Finance Portal
4. **Should see** 4 pending PRs ready for review
5. **Test** Approve/Decline/Split functions
6. **Test** HOD portal shows same PRs
7. **Test** Employee dashboard shows correct status

## Troubleshooting

### If Finance portal still shows 0 PRs:

1. **Clear browser cache**: 
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Refresh page

2. **Check browser console** for errors:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for error messages
   - Check Network tab to see API calls

3. **Verify user role**:
   - Log in as Finance user
   - Open browser console and paste:
     ```javascript
     const user = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'));
     console.log('User role:', user?.role);
     ```
   - Should show `"Finance"`

4. **Check database directly**:
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - SQL Editor
   - Run: `SELECT role FROM public.users WHERE email = 'michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com';`
   - Should return `Finance`

5. **Enable detailed logging**:
   - Open browser DevTools Console
   - Should see messages like:
     - `üìã Loading Finance portal PRs...`
     - `‚úÖ Loaded Finance pending PRs: 4`

### If error messages appear:

- Check the ERRORS section in the output
- Common issues:
  - **RLS policy violation**: User role not set correctly - run `UPDATE` query above
  - **Connection error**: Check Supabase URL and keys are correct
  - **401 Unauthorized**: User JWT expired - log out and back in

## Success Indicators
