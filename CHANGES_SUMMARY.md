# Summary of Changes Made

## ✅ 1. Removed "Sage System" References
- ❌ Removed "(Sage System Style)" from Split Transaction header
- ❌ Removed "(Like Sage System)" from help text
- ❌ Removed "as per Sage system workflow" from success messages
- ❌ Removed "as per Sage system" from split reason text

## ✅ 2. Smart Item Recognition for Splits
Enhanced auto split functionality to intelligently recognize multiple items:

### **Before**:
- "dell laptop and chairs - Part 1"
- "dell laptop and chairs - Part 2"

### **After**:
- "dell laptop" (when "and" detected)
- "chairs" (automatically separated)

### **Detection Logic**:
- Looks for separators: " and ", " & ", ", ", " + ", " plus "
- Splits description by detected separator
- Creates individual split items for each detected item
- Uses 80% of total amount for detected items (leaves 20% remainder)
- Falls back to generic split if no separators found

## ✅ 3. App Name Changes
- **Changed**: "ProcureFlow" → **"Oversight"**

## ✅ 4. Navigation Label Changes
- **Changed**: "PR History" → **"Purchase Requisition History"**
- **Changed**: "PRs for Final Approval" → **"Purchase Requisitions For Final Approval"**

## ✅ 5. Analytics Interface Fix
- **Removed**: Duplicate "Analytics Dashboard" title
- **Fixed**: Now shows "Analytics" in header (from Layout) only once
- **Updated**: Description text to focus on procurement management
- **Changed**: "Analytics Overview" → **"Analytics"** in title

## ✅ 6. Split Display Logic
The system now:
- **Keeps original PR** with full original amount
- **Shows split amounts** in individual split rows
- **Smart detection** of multiple items from description
- **Better remainder calculation** based on detected items

## Example Usage:

### Input: "dell laptop and chairs"
**Auto Split Result**:
- Split Item 1: "dell laptop" - Amount based on item proportion
- Split Item 2: "chairs" - Amount based on item proportion  
- Remainder: 20% of original amount
- Original PR: Kept with full original amount

### Input: "office supplies"
**Auto Split Result** (fallback):
- Split Item 1: "office supplies (Split 1)" - 35% of original
- Split Item 2: "office supplies (Split 2)" - 35% of original
- Remainder: 30% of original amount

## Technical Implementation:
- **SplitPRModal.tsx**: Enhanced with smart item detection
- **FinalizationModal.tsx**: Enhanced with smart item detection  
- **Layout.tsx**: Updated app name and navigation labels
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Updated button text
- **AnalyticsOverview.tsx**: Fixed duplicate title issue
