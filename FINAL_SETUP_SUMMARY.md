## 🔒 Security Considerations

- ✅ Tokens are unique per invitation
- ✅ Tokens expire after 7 days
- ✅ Invitations can be deleted/revoked
- ✅ RLS policies restrict data access
- ✅ Email addresses are validated
- ✅ Only authenticated users can create invitations
- ✅ Sender email must be verified in Resend
- ✅ API keys stored securely in Supabase

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting Quick Guide

### Problem: Email not sending
**Solution**: Check debug monitor for status. If failed, read error message. Most likely:
- RESEND_API_KEY not set in Supabase
- API key is incorrect
- Sender email not verified

### Problem: Email arrives but link doesn't work
**Solution**: 
- Check your app is deployed on correct domain
- Verify app URL is accessible from internet
- Test invite link manually in browser

### Problem: Users see "Access Denied" on signup page
**Solution**:
- Check that their role is spelled exactly (Employee/HOD/Finance/Admin/SuperUser)
- Check that user record exists in database
- Clear browser cache

### Problem: After signup, user doesn't redirect to portal
**Solution**:
- Check user role in database
- Check RLS policies allow user to read own profile
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
