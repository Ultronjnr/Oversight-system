2. **A panel opens** showing email events in real-time
3. **Look for your test invitation**:

```
Status: PENDING  →  "Sending email via Resend..."
Status: SENT     →  "Email sent successfully via resend"
Status: FAILED   →  "Failed to send email - check debug log"  [ERROR: ...]
```

---

## 📨 Step 4: Check Your Email

### If Email Service is Configured:

1. **Check your inbox** (michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com)
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** (Resend takes a bit)
3. **Look for email from**: Oversight (sender: Michaelmokhoro08@gmail.com)
4. **Subject**: "Welcome to Oversight - Complete Your Account Setup"

### If Email Didn't Arrive:

- **Check Spam folder** (sometimes emails go there)
- **Check Debug Log**:
  - Status "FAILED" → Error message shows the problem
  - Status "PENDING" (stuck) → Click back button, try again

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting via Debug Monitor

### Debug Status Meanings:

| Status | Meaning | What to Do |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **PENDING** | Email is being sent | Wait 5 seconds, should change to SENT or FAILED |
| **SENT** | Email was sent successfully! | Check your inbox (wait 1-2 mins) |
| **FAILED** | Error occurred | Read the error message below email details |

### Common Error Messages:

**"RESEND_API_KEY not set"**
- Solution: Go to Supabase → Edge Functions → Settings → Add `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable

**"Resend error 401"**
- Solution: Your API key is wrong. Get the correct one from https://resend.com

**"Resend error 400"**
- Solution: Sender email not verified. Verify it in Resend dashboard first

**"Could not connect to server"**
- Solution: Edge Function not deployed. Redeploy the function in Supabase
