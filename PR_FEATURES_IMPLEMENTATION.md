# PR Features Implementation Progress

## Tasks Completed ✅

### 1. Added Approval/Decline Notifications
**File**: `src/components/FinalizationModal.tsx`
- Added toast notification when PR is approved/declined
- Message includes: PR reference, action (approved/declined), approver role, and comments
- Shows different styling for approve (success) vs decline (destructive)

### 2. Split Items Display as Separate Rows
**File**: `src/components/PurchaseRequisitionTable.tsx`
- Created `getDisplayPRs()` function to flatten split items into separate table rows
- Split items show with:
  - Purple background highlight
  - "Split" badge on the PR Reference
  - Category field display
  - Correct amount for each split item
  - "Split Item" label in amount column

### 3. Document Download Fix
**File**: `src/components/DocumentViewer.tsx`
- Fixed error state initialization (changed `false` to `null`)
- Need to: Add better URL validation and fallback handling

## Tasks Remaining ⏳

### 1. Complete Document Download Fix
- Add URL validation before attempting download
- Handle missing or invalid URLs gracefully
- Test with Supabase storage URLs

### 2. Add Real-time Status Updates
- After approval/decline, refresh the PR list immediately
- Update status badges in real-time
- Add loading state while updating

### 3. Add PR History Display
- Create PR History component showing:
  - Timestamp of each action
  - Action taken (Submitted, Approved, Declined, Split, etc.)
  - Who performed the action (name and role)
  - Comments/reason provided
  - Clean, chronological format

### 4. Add Refresh Callbacks
- Pass `onRefresh` prop to PurchaseRequisitionTable
- Call `onRefresh()` after successful approval/decline
- Update Finance and HOD portals to reload PRs

## Code Changes Made

### src/components/FinalizationModal.tsx (Line ~300)
```typescript
// Added after onFinalize call:
toast({
  title: decision === 'approve' ? '✅ PR Approved' : '❌ PR Declined',
  description: `PR ${purchaseRequisition.transactionId} has been ${decision === 'approve' ? 'approved' : 'declined'} by ${actionRole}. ${comments}`,
  variant: decision === 'approve' ? 'default' : 'destructive'
});
```

### src/components/PurchaseRequisitionTable.tsx
**Changes**:
1. Added `onRefresh?: () => void` to interface
2. Created `getDisplayPRs()` function
3. Updated `.map((pr, index)` to `.map((pr, index)` with `getDisplayPRs()`
4. Updated row styling: Added purple background for split items
5. Updated PR Reference display with Split badge
6. Updated Amount display with category and split item indicator

## Files Still Need Updating

1. **src/pages/FinancePortal.tsx**
   - Pass `onRefresh` to PurchaseRequisitionTable
   - Call refresh after approval in `handleFinanceApprove`

2. **src/pages/HODPortal.tsx**
   - Pass `onRefresh` to PurchaseRequisitionTable
   - Call refresh after approval in `handleHODFinalize`

3. **src/pages/Dashboard.tsx**
   - Ensure notifications are shown after actions
   - Add PR history display

4. **Create new component**: `src/components/PRHistory.tsx`
   - Display PR approval workflow history
   - Show timestamps, actions, actors, and comments

## Database Considerations

Split items should be stored as:
- Separate records in `purchase_requisitions` table with `original_transaction_id` field
- OR as JSONB array in `split_items` field
- Include: description, amount, category, vat_classification
