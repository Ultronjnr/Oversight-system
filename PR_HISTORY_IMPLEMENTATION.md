# PR History Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
The PR History component has been successfully created and integrated. Users can now view a detailed timeline of all actions taken on each Purchase Requisition.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New Component: PRHistory.tsx
**Location**: `src/components/PRHistory.tsx`

**Features**:
- Timeline display of all PR actions with vertical line and dots
- Support for multiple action types:
  - **Submitted** - Initial submission with gray clock icon
  - **Approved** - Green checkmark with success styling
  - **Rejected** - Red X with destructive styling
  - **Split** - Blue tag icon for split operations
  
- For each entry shows:
  - Action type with color-coded badge
  - Actor role (Employee, HOD, Finance)
  - Formatted timestamp (e.g., "Jan 15, 2024 • 14:30:45")
  - Comments or rejection reason with styled quote block
  - Summary statistics (total actions, approvals, rejections)

- Empty state handling when no history exists

### 2. Updated: PurchaseRequisitionTable.tsx
**Key Changes**:
- Added PRHistory component import
- Added tabbed interface in PR Details dialog:
  - **Items & Details** tab (default)
  - **History** tab
- Added History icon button (⏱️) on every PR row for quick history access
- Tab switching managed by `detailsTab` state

**How to Access**:
1. Click "View all items" in the Items column → Opens dialog, click History tab
2. Click History icon (⏱️) button → Directly opens History view
3. In action rows (HOD/Finance portals), History button is visible alongside Finalize/Split

### 3. Updated: purchaseRequisitionService.ts
**Key Changes**:
- createPurchaseRequisition() now adds initial "Submitted" history entry
- Entry includes:
  - Action: "Submitted"
  - By: Employee name
  - Role: Employee role
  - Timestamp: ISO format
  - Comments: "Purchase requisition submitted for approval"

### 4. Automatic History Tracking (Already Existing)
The following actions are automatically tracked:
- **Approval**: approveRequisition() adds "Approved" entry with approver role
- **Rejection**: rejectRequisition() adds "Rejected" entry with reason
- **Split**: splitRequisition() adds "Split" entry to both parent and child PRs

## Data Structure

History entries in the `purchase_requisitions.history` JSONB field:
```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  action: string;           // 'Submitted', 'Approved', 'Rejected', 'Split'
  by: string;              // Name of person who performed action
  role?: string;           // 'Employee', 'HOD', 'Finance'
  timestamp: string;       // ISO 8601 format
  comments?: string;       // For approvals
  reason?: string;         // For rejections
  notes?: string;          // For splits
  parentId?: string;       // For split entries (ID of original PR)
  splitInto?: string[];    // For split entries (IDs of new PRs)
}
```
