# Supabase Edge Function Deployment Guide

## Overview

The `send-invitation-email` Edge Function is responsible for sending invitation emails to users. It's a serverless function that runs on Supabase's infrastructure and integrates with Resend for email delivery.

---

## STEP 1: Ensure Edge Function Code is in Place

The function code should be located at:
```
supabase/functions/send-invitation-email/index.ts
```

Verify the file exists and contains the enhanced diagnostic code with detailed logging.

---

## STEP 2: Deploy the Edge Function to Supabase

### Option A: Using Supabase CLI (Recommended for Local Development)

If you have the Supabase CLI installed:

```bash
# Login to Supabase (if not already logged in)
supabase login

# Deploy the function
supabase functions deploy send-invitation-email --project-id mknamvkplhusntnarcmb
```

### Option B: Using Supabase Dashboard (Web UI)

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select your project: **mknamvkplhusntnarcmb**
3. Navigate to **Functions** in the left sidebar
4. Look for `send-invitation-email`
5. If it exists, click to open it and verify the code is up to date
6. If it doesn't exist:
   - Click **Create a new function**
   - Name it: `send-invitation-email`
   - Paste the contents of `supabase/functions/send-invitation-email/index.ts`

## Troubleshooting

### Email Shows "Sent" in Debug but Not Received

**Possible Causes:**
1. Email is in Spam/Junk folder
2. Sender email not verified in Resend
3. Email provider blocking the message

**Solutions:**
1. Check Spam, Promotions, and other folders
2. Check Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Activity to confirm "Delivered" status
3. Create a verified domain in Resend (not just an email)
   - Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Verify DNS records
   - Use email like `noreply@yourdomain.com`

### Function Logs Show "RESEND_API_KEY not set"

**Cause:** Environment variable not configured

**Solution:**
1. Go to Supabase Functions ‚Üí Settings
2. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` with your full Resend API key
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 30 seconds
5. Try sending another test invitation

### Function Logs Show "API key is invalid"

**Cause:** The API key format is wrong or incomplete

**Solutions:**
1. Go to [Resend Dashboard](https://dashboard.resend.com)
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
3. Copy the **full** API key (should start with `re_`)
4. Count characters to ensure it's complete (40+ chars)
5. Update in Supabase Functions ‚Üí Settings
6. Try again

### Resend Shows "Rejected" Status

**Cause:** Sender email not verified or domain issue

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Resend Dashboard ‚Üí Verified Domains & Senders
2. Verify that your sender email is in the list and marked **Verified**
3. If not, click **Add Email** and follow verification steps
4. Or create a verified domain instead (better deliverability)
